# Box

Box component is an abstract `div` component that can be used to easily build ui layouts or as a primitive for building more complex and specific ui elements.

Box uses the following style functions from the Styled System API: `space`, `layout`, `color`, `border`, and `boxShadow`. These utilities allow Box to 
accept a range of responsive style props such as margin, padding, height, width, color, etc. For a full reference check out the [Styled System API](https://styled-system.com/api).

## Usage

```js
import { Box } from 'composite-ui';
```

## Examples

```jsx live=true
<Box 
  bg="black.1" 
  w="100%" 
  p={3} 
  color="white" 
  borderRadius={1}>
  This is a Box
</Box>
```

```jsx live=true
<Box 
  width="100%" 
  boxShadow={1} 
  p={3}
  borderRadius={1}>
  This Box has shadow
