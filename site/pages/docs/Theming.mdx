# Theming

Composite UI is a design system first component library. This means all ui elements are intended to be controlled by the 
theme you provide using the `ThemeProvider`. The includes everything from different component variants to overall ui spacing, typography, colors,
and more. The theme format that Composite UI uses is based on the [System UI Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme).

## Building a theme

To create your own theme object you simply need to follow the System UI structure. If you are using Typescript, then simply define your theme object 
using the `ITheme` interface exported by `composite-ui`.

## Composite UI theme

Composite UI provides a default theme out of the box that you can start using right away or modify/customize in any way you see fit.
