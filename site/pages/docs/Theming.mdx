# Theming

Composite UI is a design system first component library. This means all ui elements are intended to be controlled by the 
theme you provide using the `ThemeProvider`. The includes everything from different component variants to overall ui spacing, typography, colors,
and more. The theme format that Composite UI uses is based on the [System UI Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme).

To create your own theme object you simply need to follow the System UI structure. If you are using Typescript, then simply define your theme object 
using the `ITheme` interface exported by `composite-ui`.

Alternatively, Composite UI provides a default theme out of the box that you can start using right away or modify/customize in any way you see fit.
Below is a reference for what the default theme includes.

## Colors

There are a lot of different ways to structure your theme's color scheme. Often times it is useful to have fields oriented 
around usecase such as `text`, `background`, etc. so that you can easily reference the color you want like this:

```jsx live="true"
<Text color="text.secondary">
  Hello world
</Text>
```

For additional colors you can have extra keys for each kind of color in your application. In the Composite UI theme, we have kept
things simple and use arrays for each set of colors. These can then be referenced in code with dot notation like `color="gray.3"`.

A more complex color system will often prefer to have color palettes that have saturation levels for each color ranging from 10 to 900. 
These colors are then referenced by their saturation level, such as `gray.20`, `gray.50` etc. The theme object shape makes no assumptions
about how you will structure your color scheme. If you prefer to use saturation numbers, you can build a theme like this:

```js
const theme = {
  // ...
  colors: {
    gray: {
      // ...
      40: '#F4F5F6',
      // ...
      300: '#D9DBDC'
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

You can then reference these colors in code by saying `color="gray.40"`.

### Text

<Palette group="text"/>

### Background

<Palette group="background"/>


## Spacing

```js
const theme = {
  space: [0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512],
  // ...
}
```
